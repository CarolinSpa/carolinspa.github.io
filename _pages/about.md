I am a PhD candidate in Economics at KU Leuven in Belgium under the supervision of [Michal Kobielarz](https://sites.google.com/site/michalkobielarz/home) and [Christian Pr√∂bsting](https://sites.google.com/site/proebstingchristian/home).

My research interests lie in the intersection of **international macroeconomics**, **monetary economics**, and **inequality**. In particular, I focus on how structural differences between member states in currency unions shape macroeconomic dynamics, affecting both shock transmission and the effectiveness of monetary policy.

My research is funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) fundamental research grant.

You can find my CV [here](../files/CV.pdf).
